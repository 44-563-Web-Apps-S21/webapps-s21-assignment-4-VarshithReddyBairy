                Nay, but this dotage of our general's<br>
                O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<br>
                That o'er the files and musters of the war<br>
                Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<br>
                The office and devotion of their view<br>
                Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,<br>
                Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
                The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<br>
                And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
                To cool a gipsy's lust.<br>
        </p>
        <p ><i class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning

        <p class="speech PHILO">Look, where they come:<br>
                Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<br>
                The triple pillar of the world transform'd<br>
                Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.</p>

        <p class="speech CLEOPATRA">Nay, hear them, Antony:<br>
                Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<br>
                If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
                His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;<br>
                Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<br>
                Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'<br>
